## a collection of ciphers as Python functions ##

Spending sometime with the topic of cryptography, and writing what I'm learning in Python. Feel free to fork and contribute more!

## ciphers ##

example,

    from psypy.ciphers.caesar import encrypt
  
    print encrypt("hello there!")
  
## layout ##

Right now as I read about any ciphers, they'll be added to the ciphers folder. Some misc scripts can be found in the tools folder.
